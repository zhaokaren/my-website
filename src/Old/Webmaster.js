                                I was tasked with designing a website/platform for the University of Toronto Engineering Society to 
                                use during the campaigning period. The purpose of this website is to augment the campaign process to 
                                allow for all candidates to have an equal platform.

                                <p>I started the design process with rough wire-framing to brainstrom different layouts to display information. I focussed first on the 2 main components, the Candidate Profile and the website layout/navigation. </p>

                                <p>Each Candidate profile required a lot of information to be displayed. In addition to static information, there will also be a "feed" which candidates are able to update to create a centralized campaigning space.</p>

                                <p>A key requirement of this project was for a way of easy navigation between Campaigns and Candidates. Below were few ideas of site layout/naviation, taking inspiration from existing websites like (courses.skule.ca)</p>

                                            and space efficient in comparison to doing a list of all the positions. When navigating each of the positions, 
                                            there were 2 options available. Route one was suggested as an initial starting point for the website, but it took 
                                            up too much space, which doesn't allow for (equal space for everyone). Alternately, the individual campagin page will 
                                            continue to use the same grid system to display all of the candidates which are running for the position. I opted for
